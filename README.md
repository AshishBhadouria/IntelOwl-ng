## Installation

##### Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/intelowlproject/intelowl-ng
$ cd intelowl-ng/
```

##### Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash

```

The npm start command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into dist/, watches for changes to the source files, and runs lite-server on port 4200.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
